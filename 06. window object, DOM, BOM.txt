/*
    BOM (Browser Object Model) and DOM (Document Object Model) :
    _______________________________________________________________

    - window object is the global object of js.
        so, if we write window.console.log("Hii");
        is same as writing without using the window.

    - this window have 3 features :-
        1. DOM
        2. BOM
        3. JS Core

    - The whole html page is considered as Document and is given to JS as JS-Document called as DOM.
    - BOM is nothing but additional objects provided by the browser.
